# Experiment: Synthetic Data Validation

## Description

In this experiment we validate that the synthetic data generated by the toy model has the intended causal properties. Datasets are generated for $C=1,2,...,8$ and the causal distances TOD and TID are calculated for two settings ($\alpha_1=0,\alpha_2=1$ and $\alpha_1=1,\alpha_2=0$), corresponding to SHD, SID, OD and ID. We examine how the causal distances (averaged across all pairs of tasks) change with increasing $C$. We also examine Pearson correlation between causal distances and check that the causal distances between tasks within the same causal group are higher than causal distances between tasks in different causal groups.

## Instructions for Running the Experiment

### Preliminaries and Setup

Setup:
1. Check the `.sbatch` script/s and adapt the parameters such as number of nodes, CPUs, and memory as per your HPC cluster specifications
2. Check the hyperparameter choices in the `.sbatch` and/or `.sh` script/s and adapt according to your experiment setup

### Activate Virtual Environment

Before running the experiment, activate the virtual environment to ensure all dependencies are available:


```
source experiment_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use experiment_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Launching the Experiment

Run the experiment using the following shell command:

```
./experiments/0_synthetic_data_validation/experiment.sh
```

### Reviewing Results with Jupyter Notebook

To view detailed results and analysis, use the provided Jupyter notebook: `analysis.ipynb`. Navigate through the notebook cells to visualize results, and generate the tables and figures as presented in the paper.
