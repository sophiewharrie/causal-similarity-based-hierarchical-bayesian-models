# Preprocessing Instructions for Datasets

## Economics dataset

1. Download the raw dataset files and put them in the `data/economics` directory

- IMF World Economic Outlook dataset, April 2023 version ([link to download](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/April))
- Penn World Table dataset, version 10.01 ([link to download](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en))

2. Navigate through the notebook cells in `data/economics/data_preprocessing.ipynb` to preprocess the datasets and prepare the input files for experiments

## Medical dataset

NOTE: The preprocessing instructions assume that you have access to the UK Biobank dataset. The UK Biobank dataset is not publicly available for download, but researchers can register with UK Biobank and apply for data access ([link to more details](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)). See our paper for a detailed list of the required data fields.
